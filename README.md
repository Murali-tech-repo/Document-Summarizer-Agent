# AI-Powered DevOps Incident Analyzer

## Overview

AI-Powered DevOps Incident Analyzer is an intelligent multi-agent system built using CrewAI and Ollama to automate log analysis, issue investigation, and solution generation for DevOps and SRE teams.

The system reads logs from sources like Loki or log files, identifies critical issues, investigates related solutions using LLM reasoning, and provides actionable remediation steps.

This project is designed to reduce manual debugging time and help DevOps engineers quickly resolve infrastructure and application issues.

## 2. Issue Investigator Agent

Responsible for:

* Investigating identified issues
* Searching for related known problems
* Finding documentation references
* Understanding root causes

### Responsibilities

* Kubernetes issue investigation
* Container failure analysis
* CI/CD troubleshooting
* Infrastructure debugging

---

## 3. Solution Specialist Agent

Responsible for:

* Generating remediation plans
* Providing step-by-step fixes
* Suggesting preventive actions
* Recommending best practices

### Output Includes

* Solution steps
* Configuration fixes
* Deployment recommendations
* Preventive monitoring suggestions
